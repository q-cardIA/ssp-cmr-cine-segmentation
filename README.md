# Self-supervised pretraining for cardiovascular magnetic resonance cine segmentation

PyTorch based code used for [Self-supervised pretraining for cardiovascular magnetic resonance cine segmentation](), comparing 4 self-supervised pretraining (SSP) methods and an nnU-Net based baseline for cardiovascular magnetic resonance cine segmentation. The 4 methods are: SimCLR, positional contrastive learning (PCL), DINO, and masked image modeling (MIM), which are all visualized below:

The code uses our own [qcardia-data](https://github.com/q-cardIA/qcardia-data) and [qcardia-models](https://github.com/q-cardIA/qcardia-data) modules.
